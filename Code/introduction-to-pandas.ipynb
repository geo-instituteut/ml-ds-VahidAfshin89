    "* [Importing data](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/io.html) - we used [`pd.read_csv()`](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_csv.html#pandas-read-csv) to read in a CSV (comma-separated values) file but there are multiple options for reading data.\n",
    "* [Exporting data](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/io.html) - we exported our data using `to_csv()`, however there are multiple methods of exporting data.\n",
    "* [Describing data](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.describe.html)\n",
    "    * `df.dtypes` - find the datatypes present in a dataframe.\n",
    "    * `df.describe()` - find various numerical features of a dataframe.\n",
    "    * `df.info()` - find the number of rows and whether or not any of them are empty.\n",
    "* [Viewing and selecting data](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html#viewing-data)\n",
    "    * `df.head()` - view the first 5 rows of `df`.\n",
    "    * `df.loc` & `df.iloc` - select specific parts of a dataframe.\n",
    "    * `df['A']` - select column `A` of `df`.\n",
    "    * `df[df['A'] > 1000]` - selection column `A` rows with values over 1000 of `df`.\n",
    "    * `df['A']` - plot values from column `A` using matplotlib (defaults to line graph).\n",
    "* [Manipulating data and performing operations](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/user_guide/10min.html#operations) - pandas has many built-in functions you can use to manipulate data, also many of the Python operators (e.g. `+`, `-`, `>`, `==`) work with pandas.\n",

    "### Further reading\n",
    "Since pandas is such a large library, it would be impossible to cover it all in one go. \n",
    "\n",
    "The following are some resources you might want to look into for more.\n",
    "* [Python for Data Analysis by Wes McKinney](https://wesmckinney.com/book/) - possibly the most complete text of the pandas library (apart from the documentation itself) written by the creator of pandas.\n",
    "* [Data Manipulation with Pandas (section of Python Data Science Handbook by Jake VanderPlas)](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/03.00-introduction-to-pandas.html) - a very hands-on approach to many of the main functions in the pandas library.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercises\n",
    "After completing this notebook, you next thing should be to try out some more pandas code of your own.\n",
    "\n",
    "I'd suggest at least going through number 1 (write out all the code yourself), a couple from number 2 (again, write out the code yourself) and spend an hour reading number 3 (this is vast but keep it in mind).\n",
    "\n",
    "1. [10-minute introduction to pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/10min.html) - go through all the functions here and be sure to write out the code yourself.\n",
    "2. [Pandas getting started tutorial](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/getting_started/intro_tutorials/index.html) - pick a couple from here which spark your interest and go through them both writing out the code for your self.\n",
    "3. [Pandas essential basic functionality](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/basics.html) - spend an hour reading this and bookmark it for whenever you need to come back for an overview of pandas."
